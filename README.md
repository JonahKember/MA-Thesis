### Aims

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder thought to arise from the atypical development of large-scale functional brain networks. Different alterations in the development of these large-scale networks are thought to explain the distinct ADHD subtypes that are recognized by the DSM-V (Fair et al., 2013). Converging evidence has supported this theory, and research has now identified distinct neural signatures for each subtype through the application of graph-theory to fMRI connectivity and convolutional neural networks to raw EEG data (Ahmadi et al., 2021; Fair et al., 2013). 

Despite these advances, a theoretical understanding of the specific developmental processes that might be altered in each ADHD subtype is missing. A necessary first step towards such an understanding involves describing the atypical features associated with each ADHD subtype in a way that is relevant to how ADHD develops- through the formation of large-scale functional brain networks.

This project describes features of functional brain networks that are associated with each ADHD subtype in a non-clinical, cross-sectional sample of university-aged participants during a continuous performance task. This takes an important first step towards understanding which developmental processes might be altered in each of the ADHD subtypes, with clinical implications for the early diagnosis and intervention of ADHD.
