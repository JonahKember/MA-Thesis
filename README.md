#### The Dynamic Configuration of EEG Functional Networks is Associated with ADHD Subtype Traits in a Non-Clinical Population 

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder thought to arise from the atypical development of large-scale functional brain networks (Qian et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2017; Saad et al., 2017; Xia, 2019). Differences in how these large-scale networks develop are currently thought to explain the distinct ADHD subtypes recognized by the DSM-V (Qian et al., 2019). Converging evidence has supported this theory: distinct neural signatures for each subtype have been identified through both the application of graph-theory to fMRI connectivity and convolutional neural networks to raw EEG data (Saad et al., 2017; Ahmadi et al., 2021). While these advances suggest that the ADHD subtypes might be explained through different developmental trajectories, a theoretical understanding of which developmental processes might be altered is currently missing (Qian et al., 2017; McNorgan et al., 2020). Here, we take a necessary first step towards such an understanding by describing the atypical features of functional networks that are associated with ADHD subtype traits. Understanding which developmental processes might be altered in each of the ADHD subtypes has clinical implications for the early diagnosis and intervention of ADHD.
