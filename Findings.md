## MA Thesis Research

Following the inhibition of a motor response, EEG functional networks in the Alpha-band (8-12Hz) dynamically shift towards a less globally efficient configuration.

This shift can be seen from ~300-650 ms in the following video, which shows how functional alpha networks change over time.

The adjacency matrices in this video represent the Alpha-band networks at each time point, from 0 ms (stimulus presentation) to 800 ms. In each network, EEG sensors are nodes, and two sensors (i.e., _i_ and _j_) communicate with one another if element _ij_ is yellow. The top 10% of across-trial phase-lag index values, binarized, are used to represent communication.
