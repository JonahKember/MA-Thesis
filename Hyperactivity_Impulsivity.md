## Dynamic Configuration of EEG Networks: High vs. Low Hyperactivity/Impulsivity

When participants attempt to repond "quickly and accurately" to a stimuli that comes up on a computer screen, oscillations coming from distributed brain regions 
in the cerebral cortex begin to synchronize with one another, and a network of brain regions synchronizing with one another is formed. Interestingly, the organizaiton of 
this network is predictive of hyperactive/impulsive traits. Those who are highly hyperactive and impulsive show an organization that is less integrated 
(it takes longer for communication between brain regions to occur), and is more averse to change. Combined with gamma oscilations, which show a different, more localized organization, the configuration of these networks accounts for around 55% of variance in the hyperactivity/impulsivity scores of particpants. 

Here, you can see how much of the hyperactive/impulsive scores we can predict by only looking at how beta and gamma networks configure during the task:

### So what's going on?

Here, you can see the different organizations show by those with hyperactive and impulsive traits:

It looks like communication between posterior and frontal areas around 200-300 ms post-stimulus is markedly reduced in those that are highly hyperactive/impulsive. 
This might reflect reduced communication between areas in the fronto-parietal network and areas in the motor cortex.
