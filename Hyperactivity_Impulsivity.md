## Dynamic Configuration of EEG Networks: High vs. Low Hyperactivity/Impulsivity

When participants attempt to repond "quickly and accurately" to a stimuli that comes up on a computer screen, oscillations coming from distributed brain regions 
in the cerebral cortex begin to synchronize with one another, and a network of brain regions synchronizing with one another is formed. Interestingly, the organizaiton of 
this network is predictive of hyperactive/impulsive traits. Those who are highly hyperactive and impulsive show an organization that is less integrated 
(it takes longer for communication between brain regions to occur), and is more averse to change. Combined with gamma oscilations, which show a different, more localized organization, the configuration of these networks accounts for around 55% of variance in the hyperactive/impulsive scores of participants. 

Here, you can see how much of the hyperactive/impulsive scores we can predict by only looking at how beta and gamma networks configure during the task:

### So what's going on?

It looks like communication between posterior and frontal areas around 200-300 ms post-stimulus is markedly reduced in those that are highly hyperactive/impulsive. 
Here, you can see the different ways in which cortical networks configure in those who self-report as low on hyperactive/impulsive traits, and those who self-report as high on hyperactive/impulsive traits:

The lack of integration between frontal and posterior areas might reflect a reduced communication between areas in the fronto-parietal network and areas in the motor cortex. As you might assume, communication between these networks is likely necessary when first deciding whether its appropriate to make a response or not, and when subsequently informing areas associated with motor control.
